Cat/Dog War
Kat Yang

Project Description:
	Help my cat beat my annoying dog who always her time to time! This game is similar to airplane war game where the plane keeps shooting bullets, selectively upgrading bullets, to beat the falling enemies. There are three types of bullets in this case, and they can be upgraded by purchasing. The most recent 10 scores will be displayed on ‘history score page’

Run the Project:
	download the zip file and open main.py to run 
	press the number buttons to go to different pages. 
	‘r’ will always bring you back to home page
	‘w’, ’s’, ‘d’, ‘a’ control the cat’s location. The cat cannot go beyond half of the screen. 
	‘j’ initiates path finding bullets, which directly target the closest dog
	If the typical bullets hit before path finding bullets do, the remaining numbers of path finding bullets will be added back
	Path finding bullets cannot be initiated when super bullets are on
	When the number of path finding bullets is greater than 8, dogs' health value will increase to 100
	Press the waffle button at the top right corner to upgrade bullets
	When one dog falls on ground or the cat’s health value goes to 0, the game will end.
